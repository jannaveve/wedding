    <p><blockquote>Kyle and I will be eloping and moving our family of pets to Maine in the summer of 2023. 
    I (Janna - currently coding this page) have accepted a position as a Tenure Track Professor in the Art Department at University of Southern Maine in 
    Gorham &#43 Portland in Maine and Kyle has foolishly decided to come with me. Kyle and I met online in 2017 and are still waiting on our Match.com sponsership money. I had just completed my first year as an MFA student at Purdue University and Kyle had just started working at a brewery in West Lafayette. 
    He showed up to our date in the lowest cut tank top and the tightest pants. We went through a lot at the beginning of our relationship with the loss of Kyle's father and lots of sleepless nights preparing for my thesis. Before I met Kyle I was a much more serious (and arguably productive) person - he has forced me to remember to enjoy myself everyday since we met. 
    To Kyle: I promise to pop a Jack's pizza in the oven when you need one and to only make fun of you a little when you dress like a total dweeb. You are the hottest wife 
    I ever could have asked for and I love you as much as Dr.G loves a Y incision. <br>- Janna </blockquote>
    </p><br>
    <p><blockquote>The story of Jyle (Janna + Kyle) has many twists and turns.
From mozzarella sticks on our first date, non stop rain in Miami, meeting giant koi fish in Portland, to marathoning Desperate Housewives and Sex And The City - we’ve covered a lot of ground. 
I can say that for me (this is Kyle if that wasn’t already apparent) I have never been happier than I have been since I met Janna, and that I am so very grateful for what we have had and excited for what we have ahead of us.
Moving to Maine is going to be amazing, anxiety inducing, beautiful and full of new memories that we will make together, along with all our fur bb’s. 
To Janna: I promise to be there when you need me, give you space when you need it, and make all the best slop that a good wife could possibly make. 
There is no one else I’d rather move across the country with, get snowed in with, spend the rest of my life with, or eat a whole Jack’s pizza with.
Can’t forget the Cheetos either! 
As Worf would say, DuS puS wIghajbogh nuv'e' <br>- Kyle
